# Portfolio Website

Simple static site. I use it to show projects and link to repos.

## How I run it
Open `index.html` locally or push this folder to a GitHub repo and enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Branch `main` → `/root`).

## Notes
- Swap the GitHub links to your username (script below can do this automatically).
